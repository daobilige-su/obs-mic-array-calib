To run code, simply execute “main.m” file in Matlab. Tested in Matlab2018B, but should work with all Matlab versions after 2015A.

After successful execution, The information shown in “results.txt” file should show on Matlab console.

The code is partially based on SLAM open course provided by Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss from University of Bonn, Germany.
